Some also tracked reduction in diaper/commode use and patient mobility behavior."
Results and Outcome,What steps did successful QIPs take to implement multi-disciplinary interventions targeting medication error reduction?,"SHM_RM045, SHM_RM053, SHM_RM054","SHM_RM045, SHM_RM053, and SHM_RM054 highlight multi-disciplinary collaboration, such as workgroups with nursing and pharmacy (OCH), complex scheduling validated by pharmacists (SKCH), and doctor feedback loops in prescription review (SKP)."
Results and Outcome,What metrics were used to evaluate the effectiveness of WhatsApp bot interventions for pre-surgical education?,SHM_PE035,"SHM_PE035 used WhatsApp usage rate (98%), willingness to respond (84%), and qualitative feedback to evaluate the bot. SHM_PE023 tracked improvements in patient satisfaction survey scores, especially wait time perception."
Implementation Strategy,How was success measured in reducing prescription errors in Seng Kang Polyclinic or near misses at Bedok Polyclinic?,"SHM_RM054, SHM_RM055","SHM_RM054 and SHM_RM055 tracked error metrics like prescription error rate at SKP (<0.05%) and near misses at Bedok Polyclinic (e.g., 0.031% → 0.018%). Both used monthly trend monitoring post-intervention."
Implementation Strategy,What were the main findings from projects that used visual reminders to prevent specimen mislabeling in CGH or OCH?,SHM_RM022,SHM_RM022 used staff surveys to evaluate the effectiveness of blinking light indicators for specimen labeling. Visual cues were reported to increase staff awareness and accuracy in labeling procedures.
Implementation Strategy,What was the impact of introducing Tango commodes and fall champions on fall rates in OCH?,SHM_RM044,"SHM_RM044 introduced Tango commodes and fall champions in OCH, which contributed to a reduction in fall rate from 1.15 to 0.80 per 1,000 patient days. Champions reinforced protocols and created a safety culture."
Resource Requirement,How did staff surveys reflect the success of medication checklists or mobility signage interventions?,"SHM_RM012, SHM_CO005","SHM_RM012 used staff surveys to validate the medication checklist's effectiveness, with positive feedback on ease of use. SHM_CO005 showed improved nurse confidence and reductions in diaper/commode use from staff surveys."
Resource Requirement,How was a bin code system implemented to reduce near misses during drug picking in Bedok Polyclinic?,SHM_RM055,"SHM_RM055 implemented a bin code system for pharmacy storage, leading to near miss rate reductions from 0.031% to 0.018% within 3 months. Errors due to wrong dosage and wrong drug picking were significantly reduced."
Resource Requirement,What specific PDSA interventions were tested to reduce prescription error rates at Seng Kang Polyclinic?,SHM_RM054,"SHM_RM054 tested PDSA1–3: medication chart standardization, performance feedback to doctors, and pharmacist flagging of prescriptions.
