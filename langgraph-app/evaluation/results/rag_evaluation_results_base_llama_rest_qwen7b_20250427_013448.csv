PDSA1: Standardizing medication charts on computer monitors in the consultation rooms. These medication charts provided information on acceptable doses of commonly prescribed medications. The charts also served as reminders for doctors to counter check all prescriptions and to order all chronic medications together in one prescription.

PDSA2: Bi-weekly PE data were emailed to doctors. Doctors with the highest error rate were identified and separately interviewed to find out the mitigating factors and how to prevent these errors from recurring.

PDSA3: Pharmacy technicians assisted to put aside prescriptions where changes to medications were not indicated in the remarks and/or chronic medications were not ordered together in one prescription.

4,How did previous QIPs measure improvement in reducing inpatient falls due to toileting needs or ambulation support?,"The previous QIP measured the improvement in reducing inpatient falls due to toileting needs by analyzing the fall rates before and after implementing interventions. The baseline average fall rate was 0.63, which reduced to an average of 0.27 during the current period, indicating a reduction of 57% in falls related to toileting needs.

For ambulation support, while there is no direct mention of specific metrics or outcomes for this aspect, the project ""Encouraging Safe Active Mobilization In A Pilot Ward To Reduce Patient Falls"" reported that 86% of nursing staff were ambulating patients more often in the ward. Additionally, between April 2022 and March 2023, no fall cases occurred when mobilizing patients out of bed, ambulating to the toilet, or transferring between a bed and a geriatric chair.

5,What steps did successful QIPs take to implement multi-disciplinary interventions targeting medication error reduction?,"The successful QIPs implemented several multi-disciplinary interventions targeting medication error reduction, including:

1. **Formation of a Medication Safety Workgroup**: This group was established to address all medication safety-related issues and perform root cause analysis on incidents, proposing corrective actions.

2. **Medication Safety Bulletin**: Regularly published bulletins shared best practices and correct procedures to ensure medication safety across the hospital.

3. **Identification of Ward Champions**: These champions were tasked with reinforcing correct procedures among staff and creating awareness about new medication practices.

4. **Standardizing Medication Charts**: In some hospitals, standardized charts on computer monitors in consultation rooms provided information on acceptable doses for commonly prescribed medications, serving as reminders to doctors during prescription writing.

5. **Bi-Weekly Performance Data Reviews**: Doctors with high error rates were identified and interviewed separately to understand the causes of errors and develop strategies to prevent recurrence.

6. **Pharmacy Technicians' Assistance**: In some cases, pharmacy technicians helped in reviewing prescriptions for changes or ensuring that chronic medications were ordered together, reducing the risk of omission.

These interventions highlight a collaborative approach involving various healthcare professionals such as doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and administrative staff to enhance medication safety and reduce errors.",,22.915582,3,"CHUNK 1 || SECTION: DISCUSSION || TITLE: Enhancing Patient Safety By Eliminating Potential Prescription Errors In Sengkang Polycli || YEAR: 2022 || HOSPITAL: SHP || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_RM054 || RELEVANCE: 0.6 || CONTENT: Metadata:

7,How was success measured in reducing prescription errors in Seng Kang Polyclinic or near misses at Bedok Polyclinic?,"The success in reducing prescription errors in Seng Kang Polyclinic and near misses at Bedok Polyclinic was measured through the implementation of different strategies and periodic assessments.

For Seng Kiang Polyclinic (Project SHM_RM054):
- The project involved a series of Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles to address potential prescription errors.
  - PDSA1: No improvement in PE rates due to new doctors joining the clinic during that period.
  - PDSA2: Improvement in PE rates to <0.05% by the end of January 2021, from >0.08% in December 2020; however, this improvement was short-lived.
  - PDSA3: An improvement in PE rate to 0.05% in August 2021, from ≥0.08% between February to July 2021.

For Bedok Polyclinic (Project SHM_RM055):
- The implementation of the bin coding system helped reduce reliance on memory for locating correct medications, thereby minimizing near misses due to wrong drugs and dosage forms/strengths during picking.
- This resulted in a noticeable improvement in error rates following its introduction.

PROJECT TITLE: [SHM_RM054 - Enhancing Patient Safety By Eliminating Potential Prescription Errors In SengKang Polycli]
- No significant long-term improvements were observed in PDSA1, but subsequent cycles showed gradual improvements.

A bin coding system was identified as a possible solution to reduce the picking of wrong drugs and dosage forms/strengths. Each drug storage tray was assigned a unique bin address. A Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle was carried out from 1st August 2021 to 31st October 2021:
- Set up bin location in the planogram template.
- Pharmacy Technicians pick medications based on the bin code on each drug label.
- Collate and analyze near miss reports every month for three months.",,,,,,,,,,,
8,What were the main findings from projects that used visual reminders to prevent specimen mislabeling in CGH or OCH?,"The main finding from the project using visual reminders to prevent specimen mislabeling at CGH was that all participants (32 nurses, 15 doctors, and 2 phlebotomists) reported noticing the new visual indicator. The indicator was described as eye-catching with clear and specific words, and its location was unmissable. Additionally, the blinking lights helped fatigued nurses to see the indicator and check their specimens when in doubt. Since the implementation of these changes, there have been no incidents of mislabeling from July 2021 until the present.

9,How did staff surveys reflect the success of medication checklists or mobility signage interventions?,"Staff surveys reflected the success of the mobility signage intervention by showing that 86% of nursing staff reported ambulating patients more often in the ward, and 57% strongly agreed that with the mobility signage, their patients are using less diapers. Additionally, between April 2022 and March 2023, no fall cases occurred when mobilizing patients out of bed, ambulating to the toilet, or transferring between bed and a geriatric chair.

For the medication checklist intervention, while there were no specific staff survey results mentioned in the provided context, it was noted that an online survey indicated that the checklist had helped nursing staff be more focused and efficient during medication administration. There were also no reports of medication errors among post-TBCU reviewed patients.

year: 2022
section: METHODOLOGY

Content:
A bin coding system was identified as a possible solution to reduce the picking of wrong drugs and dosage forms/strengths. Each drug storage tray was assigned a unique bin address. A Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle was carried out from 1st August 2021 to 31st October 2021:
- Set up bin location in the planogram template.
- Pharmacy Technicians pick medications based on the bin code on each drug label.
- Collate and analyze near miss reports every month for three months.","[section: INTRODUCTION, project_code: SHM_RM055, year: 2022, hospital: SHP, relevance: 0.6] Metadata:

11,What specific PDSA interventions were tested to reduce prescription error rates at Seng Kang Polyclinic?,"The specific PDSA interventions tested to reduce prescription error rates at Sengkang Polyclinic are:

- **PDSA1**: Standardizing medication charts on computer monitors in the consultation rooms. These charts provided information on acceptable doses of commonly prescribed medications and served as reminders for doctors to counter-check all prescriptions and order chronic medications together.
- **PDSA2**: Bi-weekly performance improvement (PE) data were emailed to doctors. Doctors with the highest error rate were separately interviewed to identify mitigating factors and strategies to prevent future errors.
- **PDSA3**: Pharmacy technicians assisted in putting aside prescriptions where changes to medications were not indicated in the remarks or chronic medications were not ordered together in one prescription, reducing the risk of drug omission for future visits.

3. Medication safety vest was piloted in selected OCH wards with the aim to reduce disruptions during medication administration. The intervention was not implemented due to unsatisfactory pilot results.
4. To implement a “status board” in SCM as a “live” board to keep staff updated on the list of tasks for patients.
5. Medication safety champions at each ward were identified to further reduce the risk of medication incidents. The champions will reinforce correct procedures to ground staff and create awareness. At the same time, they will communicate with their colleagues on new medication practices if any.
6. Complicated medications scheduling in SCM will be scheduled by the medical team, which will then be verified by pharmacists prior to nursing administration.||CHUNK 3 || SECTION: ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS || TITLE: Reducing Medication Incident Rate In Outram Community Hospital (Och) || YEAR: 2022 || HOSPITAL: SCH || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_RM045 || RELEVANCE: 0.6 || CONTENT: Metadata:

section: INTERVENTIONS / INITIATIVES

Content:
The project team brainstormed and came out with the following interventions:
1. A medication safety workgroup was formed to look into all medication safety related issues. Incidents were discussed with root cause analysis, and corrective actions were proposed at workgroup level.
2. SCH monthly medication safety bulletin has been published to share best practices and correct procedures to ensure medication safety.
3. Medication safety vest was piloted in selected OCH wards with the aim to reduce disruptions during medication administration. The intervention was not implemented due to unsatisfactory pilot results.
4. To implement a “status board” in SCM as a “live” board to keep staff updated on the list of tasks for patients.
5. Medication safety champions at each ward were identified to further reduce the risk of medication incidents. The champions will reinforce correct procedures to ground staff and create awareness. At the same time, they will communicate with their colleagues on new medication practices if any.
6. Complicated medications scheduling in SCM will be scheduled by the medical team, which will then be verified by pharmacists prior to nursing administration.","[section: ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS, project_code: SHM_RM045, year: 2022, hospital: SCH, relevance: 0.6] Metadata:

Content:
We know that immobility during inpatient stay does not aid in a patient’s recovery. Between physiotherapists and nursing staff, we play a big part in getting the patient to move.

However, there is a breakdown in getting the mobility information from physiotherapy notes in Sunrise Clinical Manager (SCM) to the nurses.||CHUNK 6 || SECTION: ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS || TITLE: Encouraging Safe Active Mobilization In A Pilot Ward To Reduce Patient Falls || YEAR: 2024 || HOSPITAL: SKH || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_CO005 || RELEVANCE: 0.6 || CONTENT: Metadata:

Step 1: We designed a mobility signage with concise information of patient’s functional mobility and pictograms of the transfers and walking aids to be hung at the patient’s bedside:
Step 2: We briefed our Physiotherapists on how to fill up mobility signage after functional assessment.
Step 3: Orientated our nurses in pilot ward to mobility signage and explained the mobility terms used during their roll call.
Step 4: Monthly follow-up surveys completed by ward staff and nursing students, and collection of patient fall statistics during period of pilot study.

Content:
Root cause analysis was conducted in June 2020 and these root causes were identified:
- **Patient**: Poor self awareness and overestimation of own ability.
- **Staff**: Ramping up of wards during the COVID situation; changing of patient profile due to the pandemic.
- **Environment/Surroundings**: Physical layout of the wards, which contributed to blind spots as staff struggle to cover certain areas of the ward.
- **System**: Lack of training due to rapid ramp-up and the impact of COVID.

The members identified patient’s poor insight/overestimation of own ability and staff’s situational assessment as the primary causes of fall in OCH through voting.||CHUNK 2 || SECTION: ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS || TITLE: Reducing Inpatient Falls In Och || YEAR: 2022 || HOSPITAL: SCH || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_RM044 || RELEVANCE: 0.6 || CONTENT: Metadata:

Content:
Therefore, we conclude that mobility signage is a simple and effective communication tool between physiotherapists and ward staff allowing for patients to be mobilized with the correct level of assistance. With fast access to patient’s mobility status, there is quicker and safer decision-making by ward staff as the time saved can easily be up to 5 mins for each patient.","[section: ANALYSIS OF PROBLEM, project_code: SHM_RM044, year: 2022, hospital: SCH, relevance: 0.6] Metadata:

PROJECT TITLE: SHM_RM052_SCH - Reduce fall rate of all patients at SKCH to less than 0.99 patient fall per 1000patients
- Established high fall wards for patients with high risk of falling.
- Placed signage on toilet doors and shower doors to remind staff and patients that patients should not be left alone in toilets.

PROJECT TITLE: SHM_RM044_SCH - Reducing inpatient falls in OCH
- Placed signage on toilet doors and shower doors to remind staff and patients that patients should not be left alone in toilets.
- Piloted TEMI robots to display fall prevention messages and videos to patients.
