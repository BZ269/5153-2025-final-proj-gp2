1,Show me previous projects on medication reconciliation or reducing prescription errors using checklists or pharmacist review.,"There are several relevant projects that focus on improving patient safety through medication reconciliation and reducing prescription errors, often involving the use of checklists or pharmacist reviews.

PROJECT TITLE: SHM_RM054_SHP - Enhancing Patient Safety By Eliminating Potential Prescription Errors In Sengkang Polycli
- Focuses on eliminating potential prescription errors in SengKang Polyclinic.
- Utilizes a systematic approach, possibly including checklists and pharmacist review to enhance patient safety.

PROJECT TITLE: SHM_RM012_SHP - Improving The Rate Of Medication Error For Patients Post Tbcu Review At Bukit Merah Poly
- Aims at improving the rate of medication errors for patients post-TBCU (Transitional Care Unit) review.
- Likely involves pharmacist reviews and checklists to ensure accurate medication reconciliation.

No other projects in the provided context specifically mention the use of checklists or pharmacist reviews, but they all aim to reduce medication incidents and improve patient safety.","SHM_RM054, SHM_RM012",33.310663,15,"CHUNK 1 || SECTION: SUSTAINABILITY AND SPREAD || TITLE: Enhancing Patient Safety By Eliminating Potential Prescription Errors In Sengkang Polycli || YEAR: 2022 || HOSPITAL: SHP || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_RM054 || RELEVANCE: 0.8 || CONTENT: Metadata:

PDSA1: Standardizing medication charts on computer monitors in the consultation rooms. These medication charts provided information on acceptable doses of commonly prescribed medications. The charts also served as reminders for doctors to counter check all prescriptions and to order all chronic medications together in one prescription.

PDSA2: Bi-weekly PE data were emailed to doctors. Doctors with the highest error rate were identified and separately interviewed to find out the mitigating factors and how to prevent these errors from recurring.

PDSA3: Pharmacy technicians assisted to put aside prescriptions where changes to medications were not indicated in the remarks and/or chronic medications were not ordered together in one prescription. This would reduce error in drug omission for future visits.||CHUNK 5 || SECTION: CONCLUSION || TITLE: Enhancing Patient Safety By Eliminating Potential Prescription Errors In Sengkang Polycli || YEAR: 2022 || HOSPITAL: SHP || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_RM054 || RELEVANCE: 0.8 || CONTENT: Metadata:

section: BACKGROUND

Content:
A near miss is an error or incident that is detected and prevented before reaching the patient. If such an error is undetected and goes to the patient, it may potentially lead to an adverse drug event and cause harm to the patient.

SHP-Bedok is a fast-paced primary care polyclinic with a high patient load. The number of pharmacy near misses had escalated in June and July 2021 compared to earlier months in the same year. These near misses occurred during the picking stage of the drug preparation process. Possible causes are high patient workload, constant interruptions, and staff fatigue.

Newly employed staff and relief staff from other polyclinics have difficulties locating and picking the medications due to drugs not being arranged according to their therapeutic indication in the pharmacy. In addition, staff who were familiar with the location of the drugs in the pharmacy tended to rely on memory to locate and pick medications to fill the prescriptions. However, mental fatigue could result in staff experiencing a lapse or slip in memory, thus picking the wrong drug, dosage form, or strength and resulting in an error.||CHUNK 8 || SECTION: ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS || TITLE: Implementation Of Bin Code Location To Reduce Pharmacy Near Misses In Bedok Polyclinic || YEAR: 2022 || HOSPITAL: SHP || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_RM055 || RELEVANCE: 0.6 || CONTENT: Metadata:

Content:
Despite improvements post-implementation, some challenges persisted such as staff misreading the bin code or relying on muscle memory instead of specific locations for drug retrieval. These could be due to close proximity between similar-looking medications that were changed in brand or packaging.",
8,What were the main findings from projects that used visual reminders to prevent specimen mislabeling in CGH or OCH?,"The project at CGH (Clementine General Hospital) found that implementing a new visual indicator significantly reduced and prevented specimen errors by ensuring all staff noticed and adhered to proper labelling guidelines.

PROJECT TITLE: SHM_RM022_CGH - Zero Error
- Post-implementation survey results showed high visibility of the new visual indicators among 32 nurses, 15 doctors, and 2 phlebotomists.
- The implementation led to zero incidents of mislabelling since July 2021.
- Key features included eye-catching visuals, clear wording, unmissable location, and blinking lights for day and night visibility.",SHM_RM022,24.273972,7,"CHUNK 1 || SECTION: RESULTS || TITLE: Zero Error || YEAR: 2022 || HOSPITAL: CGH || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_RM022 || RELEVANCE: 0.8 || CONTENT: Metadata:

Post Implementation Survey:
32 nurses, 15 doctors, and 2 phlebotomists who were involved in specimen labelling, collection, and dispatching participated in the post-implementation survey.
In the survey, none of the participants reported noticing the previous visual poster. With the new implementation, all 32 nurses, 15 doctors, and 2 phlebotomists reported that they saw the visual indicator as it was eye-catching, the words were very clear and specific, and the location of the indication is unmissable. In addition, the blinking lights were very eye-catching during the day and nighttime and helped with those fatigue nurses to see the visual indicator and check their specimens again when they were in doubt.||CHUNK 2 || SECTION: METHODOLOGY || TITLE: Zero Error || YEAR: 2022 || HOSPITAL: CGH || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_RM022 || RELEVANCE: 0.8 || CONTENT: Metadata:

Over a period of 2 weeks, training was conducted to all staff nurses who are involved in specimen collection, labelling and despatching using CGH policy on specimen collection.

Prior to training, 32 nurses were asked to evaluate their understanding of the guideline on specimen collection:
- 28 nurses were confident
- 2 nurses were somewhat sure on the Guideline
- 2 new nurses were unsure of the Guideline.

After the training, all the 32 nurses were able to articulate the correct process as per CGH guidelines.

1. A medication safety workgroup was formed to look into all medication safety related issues. Incidents were discussed with root cause analysis, and corrective actions were proposed at workgroup level.
2. SCH monthly medication safety bulletin has been published to share best practices and correct procedures to ensure medication safety.
3. Medication safety vest was piloted in selected OCH wards with the aim to reduce disruptions during medication administration. The intervention was not implemented due to unsatisfactory pilot results.
4. To implement a “status board” in SCM as a “live” board to keep staff updated on the list of tasks for patients.
5. Medication safety champions at each ward were identified to further reduce the risk of medication incidents. The champions will reinforce correct procedures to ground staff and create awareness. At the same time, they will communicate with their colleagues on new medication practices if any.
6. Complicated medications scheduling in SCM will be scheduled by the medical team, which will then be verified by pharmacists prior to nursing administration.","[section: INTERVENTIONS / INITIATIVES, project_code: SHM_RM053, year: 2022, hospital: SCH, relevance: 0.6] Metadata:

1. In reducing omission due to medications stock not available in SKCH or SKH pharmacy, the ward pharmacy and nursing team will perform handover to account for the number of medications left in the patient’s medication box.
2. Alps team will check expiry date of ward stock every month and expiring items are removed 3 months prior to expiry for safety purpose.
3. Wrong supply from formulary was addressed by implementing non alphabetical bin location at pharmacy.
4. Auto-perfection function in SCM was disabled to prevent system auto select lowest dose for verification which lead to downstream wrong labelling of patients own medications.
5. Nursing-in house training modules established to train nursing staff on medication management.
6. Sharing of medication incident with learning points to all staff via monthly bulletin.
7. The use of medication vest was also piloted in the ward.
8. Medication safety champions at each ward were identified and they will reinforce correct practices to ground staff and create awareness.
9. Complicated medications scheduling in SCM is done by medical, which will then be verified by pharmacist prior to nursing administration.","[section: INTERVENTIONS / INITIATIVES, project_code: SHM_CO005, year: 2024, hospital: SKH, relevance: 0.6] Metadata:

section: BACKGROUND

Content:
A near miss is an error or incident that is detected and prevented before reaching the patient. If such an error is undetected and goes to the patient, it may potentially lead to an adverse drug event and cause harm to the patient.

SHP-Bedok is a fast-paced primary care polyclinic with a high patient load. The number of pharmacy near misses had escalated in June and July 2021 compared to earlier months in the same year. These near misses occurred during the picking stage of the drug preparation process. Possible causes are high patient workload, constant interruptions, and staff fatigue.

Newly employed staff and relief staff from other polyclinics have difficulties locating and picking the medications due to drugs not being arranged according to their therapeutic indication in the pharmacy. In addition, staff who were familiar with the location of the drugs in the pharmacy tended to rely on memory to locate and pick medications to fill the prescriptions. However, mental fatigue could result in staff experiencing a lapse or slip in memory, thus picking the wrong drug, dosage form, or strength and resulting in an error.||CHUNK 8 || SECTION: OUTCOME || TITLE: Implementation Of Bin Code Location To Reduce Pharmacy Near Misses In Bedok Polyclinic || YEAR: 2022 || HOSPITAL: SHP || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_RM055 || RELEVANCE: 0.8 || CONTENT: Metadata:

PDSA1: Standardizing medication charts on computer monitors in the consultation rooms. These medication charts provided information on acceptable doses of commonly prescribed medications. The charts also served as reminders for doctors to counter check all prescriptions and to order all chronic medications together in one prescription.

PDSA2: Bi-weekly PE data were emailed to doctors. Doctors with the highest error rate were identified and separately interviewed to find out the mitigating factors and how to prevent these errors from recurring.

PDSA3: Pharmacy technicians assisted to put aside prescriptions where changes to medications were not indicated in the remarks and/or chronic medications were not ordered together in one prescription.

The findings indicate that while standardizing medication charts did not significantly reduce the prescription error rates (PDSA1), regular feedback and support for doctors (PDSA2) led to a short-term reduction in errors, but with sustainability issues. Long-term improvement was observed through continuous monitoring and assistance from pharmacy technicians (PDSA3).||CHUNK 3 || SECTION: METHODOLOGY || TITLE: Enhancing Patient Safety By Eliminating Potential Prescription Errors In Sengkang Polycli || YEAR: 2022 || HOSPITAL: SHP || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_RM054 || RELEVANCE: 0.6 || CONTENT: Metadata:

12,What metrics were commonly used to evaluate fall prevention interventions?,"Fall rates per 1000 patient days were commonly used to evaluate the effectiveness of fall prevention interventions in the projects reviewed. This metric was utilized to measure reductions in falls across different wards and hospitals.

PROJECT TITLE: Reduce Fall Rate Of All Patients At Skch To Less Than 0.99 Patient Fall Per 1000Patients (SHM_RM052)
- The project aimed to reduce fall rates below 0.99 per 1000 patient days.
- Interventions were piloted in high-risk wards and then spread hospital-wide after showing effectiveness.

PROJECT TITLE: Encouraging Safe Active Mobilization In A Pilot Ward To Reduce Patient Falls (SHM_CO005)
- While this project focused on safe mobilization, it indirectly contributed to fall prevention by reducing the use of commodes and increasing patient ambulation.
- Fall rates were not directly measured in this project.

PROJECT TITLE: Reducing Inpatient Falls In Och (SHM_RM044)
- The project reported a reduction in fall rate to 0.80 per 1,000 patient days from June 2020 to May 2021.
- This metric was used to evaluate the success of interventions aimed at reducing falls among inpatients.","SHM_RM052, SHM_CO005, SHM_RM044",32.011882,8,"CHUNK 1 || SECTION: SUSTAINABILITY AND SPREAD || TITLE: Reduce Fall Rate Of All Patients At Skch To Less Than 0.99 Patient Fall Per 1000Patients || YEAR: 2022 || HOSPITAL: SCH || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_RM052 || RELEVANCE: 0.6 || CONTENT: Metadata:

13,How was patient or staff feedback quantitatively measured in successful QIPs?,"Patient and staff feedback were quantitatively measured through various metrics such as satisfaction scores, reduction in complaints, and time savings. For instance, improvements in waiting times and willingness to recommend were tracked at SKH Emergency Department, while the use of a WhatsApp communication channel led to significant patient reassurance and reduced anxiety levels. Additionally, the implementation of robotic process automation for collecting patient-reported outcome measures resulted in substantial time savings.

PROJECT TITLE: SHM_PE023_SKH - Re-Imagining The Patient Experience At Skh Emergency Department
- Waiting Time To See Doctor (very reasonable/somewhat reasonable): 75.3% to 90.7%
- Empowerment & Care Transition (always, usually): 89.4% to 92.9%
- Willingness to Recommend (always, usually): 86.0% to 92.0%

PROJECT TITLE: SHM_PE035_SHHQ - Improve Patient Experience And Engage Patient Seamlessly Via Whatsapp Communication Channel
- The Project/Bot helped to reassure patients and reduced their level of anxiety.
- Patients were happy with the Bot and receiving information via it.
- The Bot saved clarification time, reducing dwell time by ~10% in education counselling sessions.

PROJECT TITLE: SHM_OP077_SGH - Use Of Robotic Process Automation In The Collection Of Patient-Reported Outcome Measures
- Total saved: 31,464 mins / $22,559.69.
- Ongoing monthly savings: 8631 mins / $6188.72 (based on current response rate).","SHM_PE023, SHM_PE035, SHM_OP077",36.794543,7,"CHUNK 1 || SECTION: DISCUSSION || TITLE: Enhancing Patient Safety By Eliminating Potential Prescription Errors In Sengkang Polycli || YEAR: 2022 || HOSPITAL: SHP || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_RM054 || RELEVANCE: 0.6 || CONTENT: Metadata:

The project team brainstormed and came out with the following interventions:
1. A medication safety workgroup was formed to look into all medication safety related issues. Incidents were discussed with root cause analysis, and corrective actions were proposed at workgroup level.
2. SCH monthly medication safety bulletin has been published to share best practices and correct procedures to ensure medication safety.
3. Medication safety vest was piloted in selected OCH wards with the aim to reduce disruptions during medication administration. The intervention was not implemented due to unsatisfactory pilot results.
4. To implement a “status board” in SCM as a “live” board to keep staff updated on the list of tasks for patients.
5. Medication safety champions at each ward were identified to further reduce the risk of medication incidents. The champions will reinforce correct procedures to ground staff and create awareness. At the same time, they will communicate with their colleagues on new medication practices if any.
6. Complicated medications scheduling in SCM will be scheduled by the medical team, which will then be verified by pharmacists prior to nursing administration.","[section: INTRODUCTION, project_code: SHM_RM045, year: 2022, hospital: SCH, relevance: 0.6] Metadata:

The findings indicate that while standardizing medication charts did not significantly reduce the prescription error rates (PDSA1), regular feedback and support for doctors (PDSA2) led to a short-term reduction in errors, but with sustainability issues. Long-term improvement was observed through continuous monitoring and assistance from pharmacy technicians (PDSA3).","[section: SUSTAINABILITY AND SPREAD, project_code: SHM_RM045, year: 2022, hospital: SCH, relevance: 0.6] Metadata:

Content:
“There is no time!” • Each 5 minutes spent on finding mobility status in SCM for each patient could easily add up to a significant amount of time. Time that nursing staff do not have. “Where is the information?” • Different physiotherapists write their mobility information in different areas of the notes. “Is my minimal assist the same as yours?” • Discrepancy in knowledge of patient’s current mobility status could potentially result in unsafe mobilization of patients thereby increasing risk of patient falls.||CHUNK 12 || SECTION: CONCLUSION || TITLE: Encouraging Safe Active Mobilization In A Pilot Ward To Reduce Patient Falls || YEAR: 2024 || HOSPITAL: SKH || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_CO005 || RELEVANCE: 0.8 || CONTENT: Metadata:

Content:
Therefore, we conclude that mobility signage is a simple and effective communication tool between physiotherapists and ward staff allowing for patients to be mobilized with the correct level of assistance. With fast access to patient’s mobility status, there is quicker and safer decision-making by ward staff as the time saved can easily be up to 5 mins for each patient.||CHUNK 13 || SECTION: OUTCOME || TITLE: Encouraging Safe Active Mobilization In A Pilot Ward To Reduce Patient Falls || YEAR: 2024 || HOSPITAL: SKH || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_CO005 || RELEVANCE: 0.8 || CONTENT: Metadata:

section: CONCLUSION

Content:
Therefore, we conclude that mobility signage is a simple and effective communication tool between physiotherapists and ward staff allowing for patients to be mobilized with the correct level of assistance. With fast access to patient’s mobility status, there is quicker and safer decision-making by ward staff as the time saved can easily be up to 5 mins for each patient.","[section: OUTCOME, project_code: SHM_CO005, year: 2024, hospital: SKH, relevance: 0.8] Metadata:

PROJECT TITLE: SHM_RM001_SKH - Reducing Inpatient Falls Related To Toileting Need
- Identified that elimination rounds were either delayed or not carried out due to nurses being occupied with other duties such as feeding patients via Nasogastric Tube (NGT) at 12 midnight, taking bloods at 6am - 7am.

PROJECT TITLE: SHM_RM044_SCH - Reducing Inpatient Falls In Och
- Conducted a root cause analysis in June 2020 to identify various factors leading to falls at OCH.

PROJECT TITLE: SHM_CO005_SKH - Encouraging Safe Active Mobilization In A Pilot Ward To Reduce Patient Falls
- Designed mobility signage with concise information of patient’s functional mobility and pictograms.
- Briefed Physiotherapists on how to fill up the mobility signage after a functional assessment.
- Orientated nurses in the pilot ward about the mobility signage during their roll call.
- Conducted monthly follow-up surveys by ward staff and nursing students from Oct 2022 to Dec 2022.

The project team brainstormed and came out with the following interventions:
1. A medication safety workgroup was formed to look into all medication safety related issues. Incidents were discussed with root cause analysis, and corrective actions were proposed at workgroup level.
2. SCH monthly medication safety bulletin has been published to share best practices and correct procedures to ensure medication safety.
3. Medication safety vest was piloted in selected OCH wards with the aim to reduce disruptions during medication administration. The intervention was not implemented due to unsatisfactory pilot results.
4. To implement a “status board” in SCM as a “live” board to keep staff updated on the list of tasks for patients.
5. Medication safety champions at each ward were identified to further reduce the risk of medication incidents. The champions will reinforce correct procedures to ground staff and create awareness. At the same time, they will communicate with their colleagues on new medication practices if any.
6. Complicated medications scheduling in SCM will be scheduled by the medical team, which will then be verified by pharmacists prior to nursing administration.||CHUNK 2 || SECTION: SUSTAINABILITY AND SPREAD || TITLE: Reducing Medication Incident Rate In Outram Community Hospital (Och) || YEAR: 2022 || HOSPITAL: SCH || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_RM045 || RELEVANCE: 0.8 || CONTENT: Metadata:

Initiatives completed in 2021:
- ED Patient Dashboard to provide NOKs with near real-time update of patient’s status in ED
- SCM enhancement on new column with flashing alert to alert ED doctors/nurses to provide updates to NOKs at stipulated timing
- SMS to update NOK on the admission status of the ED Patients
- Free to air TV for entertainment to keep the NOKs occupied
- Hot and cold drinks/food vending machines
- Reconfigure grieving room into 2 separate areas to provide some privacy/minimise interruption for counseling of grieving NOKs as well as to keep the toilet/water dispenser available for both staff and NOKs
- Chairs with charging points to enable NOKs to use their mobile/laptop while waiting for updates",,

Root cause analysis was conducted in June 2020 and these root causes were identified:
- **Patient**: Poor self awareness and overestimation of own ability.
- **Staff**: Ramping up of wards during the COVID situation; changing of patient profile due to the pandemic.
- **Environment/Surroundings**: Physical layout of the wards, which contributed to blind spots as staff struggle to cover certain areas of the ward.
- **System**: Lack of training due to rapid ramp-up and the impact of COVID.

The members identified patient’s poor insight/overestimation of own ability and staff’s situational assessment as the primary causes of fall in OCH through voting.||CHUNK 3 || SECTION: RESULTS || TITLE: Reducing Inpatient Falls In Och || YEAR: 2022 || HOSPITAL: SCH || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_RM044 || RELEVANCE: 0.6 || CONTENT: Metadata:

Content:
Therefore, we conclude that mobility signage is a simple and effective communication tool between physiotherapists and ward staff allowing for patients to be mobilized with the correct level of assistance. With fast access to patient’s mobility status, there is quicker and safer decision-making by ward staff as the time saved can easily be up to 5 mins for each patient.","[section: INTERVENTIONS / INITIATIVES, project_code: SHM_CO005, year: 2024, hospital: SKH, relevance: 0.8] Metadata:
