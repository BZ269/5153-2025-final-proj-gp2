The charts also served as reminders for doctors to counter check all prescriptions and to order all chronic medications together in one prescription.

PDSA2: Bi-weekly PE data were emailed to doctors. Doctors with the highest error rate were identified and separately interviewed to find out the mitigating factors and how to prevent these errors from recurring.

PDSA3: Pharmacy technicians assisted to put aside prescriptions where changes to medications were not indicated in the remarks and/or chronic medications were not ordered together in one prescription.

3,What methodology was used in successful projects that improved wait time perception at SKH Emergency Department?,"The methodology used in the project ""Re-Imagining The Patient Experience At Skh Emergency Department"" (SHM_PE023) included several initiatives aimed at improving patient and family member experiences, which likely contributed to better wait time perceptions. These initiatives involved structural and system enhancements such as an ED Patient Dashboard for real-time updates, SMS notifications for admission status, free-to-air TV entertainment, vending machines for refreshments, and reconfiguration of spaces for privacy.

**PROJECT TITLE: SHM_PE023 - Re-Imagining The Patient Experience At Skh Emergency Department**
- Implemented structural enhancements such as an ED Patient Dashboard to provide near real-time updates on patient status.
- Enhanced the Supply Chain Management (SCM) system with a new column featuring flashing alerts for timely updates to Next of Kin (NOKs).
- Sent SMS notifications to update NOKs about admission statuses.
- Provided free-to-air TV entertainment and vending machines for hot/cold drinks and food to keep NOKs occupied during wait times.
- Reconfigured spaces, such as converting a grieving room into two separate areas to provide privacy and minimize interruptions.

These measures were designed to reduce stress and improve the overall experience of waiting family members, which can positively influence their perception of wait times.",SHM_PE023,28.391632,12,"CHUNK 1 || SECTION: OUTCOME || TITLE: Re-Imagining The Patient Experience At Skh Emergency Department || YEAR: 2022 || HOSPITAL: SKH || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_PE023 || RELEVANCE: 0.8 || CONTENT: Metadata:

5,What steps did successful QIPs take to implement multi-disciplinary interventions targeting medication error reduction?,"Successful Quality Improvement Projects (QIPs) implemented multi-disciplinary interventions targeting medication error reduction through several key strategies:

1. **Formation of Multi-Disciplinary Teams**: Projects like SHM RM045 SCH and SHM_RM022 CGH formed workgroups that included pharmacists, nurses, physicians, and other healthcare professionals to address medication safety issues comprehensively.

2. **Regular Communication and Training Sessions**: These QIPs organized regular training sessions and communication channels (e.g., monthly bulletins) to ensure all team members were updated on best practices and new guidelines related to medication management.

3. **Development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**: Projects established clear SOPs for medication administration, review processes, and patient education to minimize errors.

4. **Patient Education**: Educating patients about their medications was a critical component in reducing errors. This included providing detailed information on drug usage, potential side effects, and the importance of adherence.

5. **Implementation of Visual Aids and Signage**: Some projects used visual aids like posters or signs to remind staff of important medication safety protocols at key points within the hospital environment.

6. **Regular Monitoring and Feedback Mechanisms**: Continuous monitoring through feedback loops helped identify areas for improvement and allowed teams to adjust their strategies accordingly.

7. **Collaboration with Community Partners**: Projects also extended beyond hospital walls by collaborating with community partners to ensure seamless transitions of care, which is crucial in maintaining medication safety outside the acute setting.

These steps collectively ensured a holistic approach to reducing medication errors through coordinated efforts across various disciplines and settings.","SHM_RM022, SHM_RM045",31.781565,11,"CHUNK 1 || SECTION: DISCUSSION || TITLE: Enhancing Patient Safety By Eliminating Potential Prescription Errors In Sengkang Polycli || YEAR: 2022 || HOSPITAL: SHP || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_RM054 || RELEVANCE: 0.8 || CONTENT: Metadata:

A bin coding system was identified as a possible solution to reduce the picking of wrong drugs and dosage forms/strengths. Each drug storage tray was assigned a unique bin address. A Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle was carried out from 1st August 2021 to 31st October 2021:
- Set up bin location in the planogram template.
- Pharmacy Technicians pick medications based on the bin code on each drug label.
- Collate and analyze near miss reports every month for three months.||CHUNK 14 || SECTION: BACKGROUND || TITLE: Implementation Of Bin Code Location To Reduce Pharmacy Near Misses In Bedok Polyclinic || YEAR: 2022 || HOSPITAL: SHP || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_RM055 || RELEVANCE: 0.8 || CONTENT: Metadata:

section: BACKGROUND

Content:
A near miss is an error or incident that is detected and prevented before reaching the patient. If such an error is undetected and goes to the patient, it may potentially lead to an adverse drug event and cause harm to the patient.

SHP-Bedok is a fast-paced primary care polyclinic with a high patient load. The number of pharmacy near misses had escalated in June and July 2021 compared to earlier months in the same year. These near misses occurred during the picking stage of the drug preparation process. Possible causes are high patient workload, constant interruptions, and staff fatigue.

Newly employed staff and relief staff from other polyclinics have difficulties locating and picking the medications due to drugs not being arranged according to their therapeutic indication in the pharmacy. In addition, staff who were familiar with the location of the drugs in the pharmacy tended to rely on memory to locate and pick medications to fill the prescriptions. However, mental fatigue could result in staff experiencing a lapse or slip in memory, thus picking the wrong drug, dosage form, or strength and resulting in an error.","[section: OUTCOME, project_code: SHM_RM055, year: 2022, hospital: SHP, relevance: 0.8] Metadata:

Identifying correct patient and correct labelling specimen are critical to patient’s safety. If a specimen is identified or labelled wrongly, it can lead to wrong diagnosis, treatment to the wrong patient, blood transfusion errors and more. It can also have significant consequences in patient care including delay in treatments, requiring additional laboratory tests and increasing healthcare costs which are preventable.","[section: MISSION STATEMENT, project_code: SHM_RM022, year: 2022, hospital: CGH, relevance: 0.6] Metadata:

9,How did staff surveys reflect the success of medication checklists or mobility signage interventions?,"Staff surveys reflected the success of both medication checklists and mobility signage interventions. For medication checklists, an online survey indicated that they helped staff be more focused and efficient during medication administration, with no reported medication errors among post-TBCU reviewed patients. Regarding mobility signage, 67% of nursing staff reported a reduction in the use of diapers, 93% reported a decrease in commode usage, and 86% noted an increase in patient ambulation.

section: BACKGROUND

Content:
A near miss is an error or incident that is detected and prevented before reaching the patient. If such an error is undetected and goes to the patient, it may potentially lead to an adverse drug event and cause harm to the patient.

SHP-Bedok is a fast-paced primary care polyclinic with a high patient load. The number of pharmacy near misses had escalated in June and July 2021 compared to earlier months in the same year. These near misses occurred during the picking stage of the drug preparation process. Possible causes are high patient workload, constant interruptions, and staff fatigue.

Newly employed staff and relief staff from other polyclinics have difficulties locating and picking the medications due to drugs not being arranged according to their therapeutic indication in the pharmacy. In addition, staff who were familiar with the location of the drugs in the pharmacy tended to rely on memory to locate and pick medications to fill the prescriptions. However, mental fatigue could result in staff experiencing a lapse or slip in memory, thus picking the wrong drug, dosage form, or strength and resulting in an error.","[section: TITLE OF PROJECT, project_code: SHM_RM055, year: 2022, hospital: SHP, relevance: 0.9] Metadata:

12,What metrics were commonly used to evaluate fall prevention interventions?,"**Answer:** The common metric used to evaluate fall prevention interventions is the fall rate per 1,000 patient days. This metric was used in multiple projects to measure the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing falls.

**PROJECT TITLE: SHM_RM052 - Reduce Fall Rate Of All Patients At Skch To Less Than 0.99 Patient Fall Per 1000Patients
- The project aimed to reduce fall rates across SKCH.
- Interventions were piloted in high-risk wards and then scaled up hospital-wide.
- Fall rate was reduced from an initial unspecified value to 0.69 per 1,000 patient days.

**PROJECT TITLE: SHM_RM044 - Reducing Inpatient Falls In Och
- The project focused on reducing falls at OCH.
- Fall rates were measured and reported as the number of falls per 1,000 patient days.
- The fall rate was reduced to 0.80 per 1,000 patient days during the specified period.

**PROJECT TITLE: SHM_CO005 - Encouraging Safe Active Mobilization In A Pilot Ward To Reduce Patient Falls
- This project did not focus on a numerical fall rate metric but rather on qualitative improvements in patient mobilization and use of assistive devices.
- Metrics included reductions in the use of diapers, commodes, and increases in ambulation frequency.","SHM_RM052, SHM_RM044, SHM_CO005",29.400553,10,"CHUNK 1 || SECTION: SUSTAINABILITY AND SPREAD || TITLE: Reduce Fall Rate Of All Patients At Skch To Less Than 0.99 Patient Fall Per 1000Patients || YEAR: 2022 || HOSPITAL: SCH || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_RM052 || RELEVANCE: 0.6 || CONTENT: Metadata:

13,How was patient or staff feedback quantitatively measured in successful QIPs?,"Patient or staff feedback was quantitatively measured through various methods across different Quality Improvement Projects (QIPs):

- **SHM_PE023_SKH - Re-Imagining the Patient Experience at SKH Emergency Department**: Feedback from Next of Kin (NOK) regarding waiting times and lack of information decreased significantly, from 27 cases in 2019 to 7 cases in 2021. Additionally, MOH Patient Experience Survey data showed improvements: Waiting Time To See Doctor improved from 75.3% to 90.7%, Empowerment & Care Transition from 89.4% to 92.9%, and Willingness to Recommend from 86.0% to 92.0%.

- **SHM_PE035_SHHQ - Improve Patient Experience and Engage Patient Seamlessly via WhatsApp Communication Channel**: A survey was conducted where 100% of respondents agreed that the project/bot helped reassure them, reduced anxiety levels, provided useful information, saved clarification time (reducing dwell time by ~10%), and they would recommend it to other patients.

- **SHM_PE051_NCCS - Patient Acceptability N Satisfaction**: The study surveyed 59 programme recipients from October 2020 to April 2022. Participants rated the distress screening frequency as appropriate, found it useful for their care, and had an overall satisfaction score of 7.8 on a scale where higher indicates greater satisfaction.

- **SHM_CO005_SKH - Encouraging Safe Active Mobilization in a Pilot Ward to Reduce Patient Falls**: Monthly follow-up surveys were conducted by ward staff and nursing students from October 2022 to December 2022, collecting patient fall statistics during the pilot study period.","SHM_PE023, SHM_PE035, SHM_PE051, SHM_CO005",32.003909,14,"CHUNK 1 || SECTION: RESULTS || TITLE: Adapting Cloud Based Platform For Real Time Updates || YEAR: 2022 || HOSPITAL: SKH || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_OP022 || RELEVANCE: 0.8 || CONTENT: Metadata:

Content:
Patients scheduled for planned surgery would have to grapple with a myriad of hospital processes right up to the day of their surgery. At times, patients and their caregivers could misplace or forget to bring along important admission kits issued to them which could contain important information when they visit the SGH Pre-Admission Centre (PAC). Patients would also have to manage their anxiety as they prepare for surgery while being loaded with more pre- and post-surgery information as well as undergoing educational sessions.","[section: TITLE OF PROJECT, project_code: SHM_PE035, year: 2022, hospital: SHHQ, relevance: 0.6] Metadata:

15,What indicators were used to assess medication safety in community hospitals or polyclinics?,"Indicators used to assess medication safety in community hospitals or polyclinics include the rate of prescription errors and the incidence rate of medication-related incidents. Specifically, these are measured as:

- Prescription error (PE) rates: The frequency of prescription errors per unit time.
- Medication incident rate: The number of medication-related incidents per 1000 patient days.

**PROJECT TITLE: SHM_RM054_SHP - Enhancing Patient Safety By Eliminating Potential Prescription Errors In SengKang Polycli**
- Project aimed at reducing the prescription error (PE) rate.
- PE rates were monitored from March to June 2020, with SKP's PE mostly in the red zone (<0.07%).
- The project used a Pareto chart to identify and address the top five causes of prescription errors.

**PROJECT TITLE: SHM_RM045_SCH - Reducing Medication Incident Rate In Outram Community Hospital (Och)**
- Project focused on reducing the medication incident rate.
- Monthly medication safety bulletins were published to share best practices and correct procedures for ensuring medication safety.
- The project team identified root causes such as lack of awareness, improper handover between nurses, and staff knowledge gaps regarding certain medications.

**PROJECT TITLE: SHM_RM012_SHP - Improving The Rate Of Medication Error For Patients Post Tbcu Review At Bukit Merah Poly**
- Project aimed at improving the rate of medication errors for patients post-TBCU review.
- An Ishikawa Diagram was used to analyze causes and effects, followed by a Pareto chart to determine top three causes.

**PROJECT TITLE: SHM_RM053_SCH - Reduce Medication Rate At Skch To Below 0.3 Per 1000 Patient Days (Ch Average) Over 1Yr**
- Project aimed at reducing the medication rate to below 0.3 per 1000 patient days.
- Various interventions were implemented, including collaboration between medical, nursing, and pharmacy teams, and establishing training modules for nurses-in-house.
- Root causes identified included staff not adhering to medication safety policies, interruptions during administration of medications, and knowledge deficits among staff regarding new orders.","SHM_RM054, SHM_RM045, SHM_RM012, SHM_RM053",31.71383,12,"CHUNK 1 || SECTION: DISCUSSION || TITLE: Enhancing Patient Safety By Eliminating Potential Prescription Errors In Sengkang Polycli || YEAR: 2022 || HOSPITAL: SHP || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_RM054 || RELEVANCE: 0.8 || CONTENT: Metadata:

Content:
We know that immobility during inpatient stay does not aid in a patient’s recovery. Between physiotherapists and nursing staff, we play a big part in getting the patient to move.

However, there is a breakdown in getting the mobility information from physiotherapy notes in Sunrise Clinical Manager (SCM) to the nurses.||CHUNK 7 || SECTION: ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS || TITLE: Encouraging Safe Active Mobilization In A Pilot Ward To Reduce Patient Falls || YEAR: 2024 || HOSPITAL: SKH || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_CO005 || RELEVANCE: 0.8 || CONTENT: Metadata:

Content:
“There is no time!” • Each 5 minutes spent on finding mobility status in SCM for each patient could easily add up to a significant amount of time. Time that nursing staff do not have. “Where is the information?” • Different physiotherapists write their mobility information in different areas of the notes. “Is my minimal assist the same as yours?” • Discrepancy in knowledge of patient’s current mobility status could potentially result in unsafe mobilization of patients thereby increasing risk of patient falls.||CHUNK 12 || SECTION: CONCLUSION || TITLE: Encouraging Safe Active Mobilization In A Pilot Ward To Reduce Patient Falls || YEAR: 2024 || HOSPITAL: SKH || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_CO005 || RELEVANCE: 0.8 || CONTENT: Metadata:

Content:
Therefore, we conclude that mobility signage is a simple and effective communication tool between physiotherapists and ward staff allowing for patients to be mobilized with the correct level of assistance. With fast access to patient’s mobility status, there is quicker and safer decision-making by ward staff as the time saved can easily be up to 5 mins for each patient.||CHUNK 13 || SECTION: OUTCOME || TITLE: Encouraging Safe Active Mobilization In A Pilot Ward To Reduce Patient Falls || YEAR: 2024 || HOSPITAL: SKH || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_CO005 || RELEVANCE: 0.8 || CONTENT: Metadata:

Content:
1. As our starting confidence level is already high, our increment at the end while did not hit our 30%, did show an 8% improvement. Therefore, we decided to look at other positive impacts that the signages brought e.g., increased mobility and lesser use of diapers and commodes.

Content:
Step 1: We designed a mobility signage with concise information of patient’s functional mobility and pictograms of the transfers and walking aids to be hung at the patient’s bedside:
Step 2: We briefed our Physiotherapists on how to fill up mobility signage after functional assessment.
Step 3: Orientated our nurses in pilot ward to mobility signage and explained the mobility terms used during their roll call.
Step 4: Monthly follow-up surveys completed by ward staff and nursing students, and collection of patient fall statistics during period of pilot study. (*Follow up surveys conducted every month from Oct 2022 to Dec 2022)","[section: SUSTAINABILITY AND SPREAD, project_code: SHM_CO005, year: 2024, hospital: SKH, relevance: 0.8] Metadata:

section: INTRODUCTION

Content:
We know that immobility during inpatient stay does not aid in a patient’s recovery. Between physiotherapists and nursing staff, we play a big part in getting the patient to move.

However, there is a breakdown in getting the mobility information from physiotherapy notes in Sunrise Clinical Manager (SCM) to the nurses.","[section: ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS, project_code: SHM_CO005, year: 2024, hospital: SKH, relevance: 0.8] Metadata:

Content:
The root cause lies in the inefficiency and inconsistency in how mobility information is recorded and communicated between physiotherapists and nurses, leading to potential miscommunication and delays that can impact patient safety and recovery.","[section: INTERVENTIONS / INITIATIVES, project_code: SHM_CO005, year: 2024, hospital: SKH, relevance: 0.8] Metadata:

Content:
The mobility signage system helped improve confidence among staff in handling patient transfers and increased overall mobility among patients. This was seen through reduced use of diapers and commodes as well as an increase in patient walking activity.","[section: ANALYSIS OF PROBLEM, project_code: SHM_CO005, year: 2024, hospital: SKH, relevance: 0.8] Metadata:

Content:
“There is no time!” • Each 5 minutes spent on finding mobility status in SCM for each patient could easily add up to a significant amount of time. Time that nursing staff do not have. “Where is the information?” • Different physiotherapists write their mobility information in different areas of the notes. “Is my minimal assist the same as yours?” • Discrepancy in knowledge of patient’s current mobility status could potentially result in unsafe mobilization of patients thereby increasing risk of patient falls.","[section: CONCLUSION, project_code: SHM_CO005, year: 2024, hospital: SKH, relevance: 0.8] Metadata:

section: CONCLUSION

Content:
Therefore, we conclude that mobility signage is a simple and effective communication tool between physiotherapists and ward staff allowing for patients to be mobilized with the correct level of assistance. With fast access to patient’s mobility status, there is quicker and safer decision-making by ward staff as the time saved can easily be up to 5 mins for each patient.","[section: OUTCOME, project_code: SHM_CO005, year: 2024, hospital: SKH, relevance: 0.8] Metadata:

Time that nursing staff do not have. “Where is the information?” • Different physiotherapists write their mobility information in different areas of the notes. “Is my minimal assist the same as yours?” • Discrepancy in knowledge of patient’s current mobility status could potentially result in unsafe mobilization of patients thereby increasing risk of patient falls.","[section: BACKGROUND, project_code: SHM_RM001, year: 2022, hospital: SKH, relevance: 0.8] Metadata:

The project team brainstormed and came out with the following interventions:
1. A medication safety workgroup was formed to look into all medication safety related issues. Incidents were discussed with root cause analysis, and corrective actions were proposed at workgroup level.
2. SCH monthly medication safety bulletin has been published to share best practices and correct procedures to ensure medication safety.
3. Medication safety vest was piloted in selected OCH wards with the aim to reduce disruptions during medication administration. The intervention was not implemented due to unsatisfactory pilot results.
4. To implement a “status board” in SCM as a “live” board to keep staff updated on the list of tasks for patients.
5. Medication safety champions at each ward were identified to further reduce the risk of medication incidents. The champions will reinforce correct procedures to ground staff and create awareness. At the same time, they will communicate with their colleagues on new medication practices if any.
6. Complicated medications scheduling in SCM will be scheduled by the medical team, which will then be verified by pharmacists prior to nursing administration.||CHUNK 2 || SECTION: MISSION STATEMENT || TITLE: Reducing Medication Incident Rate In Outram Community Hospital (Och) || YEAR: 2022 || HOSPITAL: SCH || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_RM045 || RELEVANCE: 0.9 || CONTENT: Metadata:

23,What methodology was used in successful projects that improved wait time perception at SKH Emergency Department?,"The methodology used in the project ""Re-Imagining The Patient Experience At Skh Emergency Department"" (SHM_PE023) included several initiatives aimed at improving patient and family member experiences, which likely contributed to better wait time perceptions. These initiatives involved structural and system enhancements such as an ED Patient Dashboard for real-time updates, SMS notifications for admission status, free-to-air TV entertainment, vending machines for refreshments, and reconfiguration of spaces for privacy.

**PROJECT TITLE: SHM_PE023 - Re-Imagining The Patient Experience At Skh Emergency Department**
- Implemented structural enhancements such as an ED Patient Dashboard to provide near real-time updates on patient status.
- Enhanced the Supply Chain Management (SCM) system with a new column featuring flashing alerts for timely updates to Next of Kin (NOKs).
- Sent SMS notifications to update NOKs about admission statuses.
- Provided free-to-air TV entertainment and vending machines for hot/cold drinks and food to keep NOKs occupied during wait times.
- Reconfigured spaces, such as converting a grieving room into two separate areas to provide privacy and minimize interruptions.

These measures were designed to reduce stress and improve the overall experience of waiting family members, which can positively influence their perception of wait times.",SHM_PE023,27.79021,13,"CHUNK 1 || SECTION: OUTCOME || TITLE: Re-Imagining The Patient Experience At Skh Emergency Department || YEAR: 2022 || HOSPITAL: SKH || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_PE023 || RELEVANCE: 0.8 || CONTENT: Metadata:

Therefore, we conclude that mobility signage is a simple and effective communication tool between physiotherapists and ward staff allowing for patients to be mobilized with the correct level of assistance. With fast access to patient’s mobility status, there is quicker and safer decision-making by ward staff as the time saved can easily be up to 5 mins for each patient.||CHUNK 5 || SECTION: BACKGROUND || TITLE: Reducing Inpatient Falls In Och || YEAR: 2022 || HOSPITAL: SCH || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_RM044 || RELEVANCE: 0.6 || CONTENT: Metadata:

Content:
Root cause analysis was conducted in June 2020 and these root causes were identified:
- **Patient**: Poor self awareness and overestimation of own ability.
- **Staff**: Ramping up of wards during the COVID situation; changing of patient profile due to the pandemic.
- **Environment/Surroundings**: Physical layout of the wards, which contributed to blind spots as staff struggle to cover certain areas of the ward.
- **System**: Lack of training due to rapid ramp-up and the impact of COVID.

The members identified patient’s poor insight/overestimation of own ability and staff’s situational assessment as the primary causes of fall in OCH through voting.||CHUNK 7 || SECTION: RESULTS || TITLE: Reducing Inpatient Falls In Och || YEAR: 2022 || HOSPITAL: SCH || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_RM044 || RELEVANCE: 0.6 || CONTENT: Metadata:

section: ANALYSIS OF PROBLEM

Content:
Root cause analysis was conducted in June 2020 and these root causes were identified:
- **Patient**: Poor self awareness and overestimation of own ability.
- **Staff**: Ramping up of wards during the COVID situation; changing of patient profile due to the pandemic.
- **Environment/Surroundings**: Physical layout of the wards, which contributed to blind spots as staff struggle to cover certain areas of the ward.
- **System**: Lack of training due to rapid ramp-up and the impact of COVID.

The members identified patient’s poor insight/overestimation of own ability and staff’s situational assessment as the primary causes of fall in OCH through voting.","[section: RESULTS, project_code: SHM_RM044, year: 2022, hospital: SCH, relevance: 0.6] Metadata:

“There is no time!” • Each 5 minutes spent on finding mobility status in SCM for each patient could easily add up to a significant amount of time. Time that nursing staff do not have. “Where is the information?” • Different physiotherapists write their mobility information in different areas of the notes. “Is my minimal assist the same as yours?” • Discrepancy in knowledge of patient’s current mobility status could potentially result in unsafe mobilization of patients thereby increasing risk of patient falls.||CHUNK 9 || SECTION: INTERVENTIONS / INITIATIVES || TITLE: Reducing Inpatient Falls Related To Toileting Need || YEAR: 2022 || HOSPITAL: SKH || PROJECT_CODE: SHM_RM001 || RELEVANCE: 0.6 || CONTENT: Metadata:

This was seen through reduced use of diapers and commodes as well as an increase in patient walking activity.","[section: INTRODUCTION, project_code: SHM_CO005, year: 2024, hospital: SKH, relevance: 0.6] Metadata:

section: INTRODUCTION

Content:
We know that immobility during inpatient stay does not aid in a patient’s recovery. Between physiotherapists and nursing staff, we play a big part in getting the patient to move.

However, there is a breakdown in getting the mobility information from physiotherapy notes in Sunrise Clinical Manager (SCM) to the nurses.","[section: OUTCOME, project_code: SHM_CO005, year: 2024, hospital: SKH, relevance: 0.6] Metadata:

Content:
“There is no time!” • Each 5 minutes spent on finding mobility status in SCM for each patient could easily add up to a significant amount of time. Time that nursing staff do not have. “Where is the information?” • Different physiotherapists write their mobility information in different areas of the notes. “Is my minimal assist the same as yours?” • Discrepancy in knowledge of patient’s current mobility status could potentially result in unsafe mobilization of patients thereby increasing risk of patient falls.","[section: INTERVENTIONS / INITIATIVES, project_code: SHM_RM001, year: 2022, hospital: SKH, relevance: 0.6] Metadata:
